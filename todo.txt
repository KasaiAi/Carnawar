Critical:
damage on dash
projectile wall rebound
wall stops dash
player jump
if projectile is hit while thrown, bump
- last thrown has priority
enemy pursue on sight
tank systems
- chutes
> drops items every ?? seconds (old ones disappear on a timer)
- cannons
- door
> locked from the outside
> can be broken (temporary?)
> can be sabotaged
> opens when tank is busted
- engine room
npc strategy (steal, sabotage, guard, fire, balance)
minimap

bidirectional animations

Optional:
fixing tank systems
grab with head
stronger throw during dash (basically the whole distance between tanks)
item weight, speed, hp

Bugs:
quickly aternating E and Space resets the throwing cooldown

Polish:
improve throw
- offset launch point slightly towards the throw direction
- adjust throw speed (more time to catch things, catch more things)
slap-offs
- quick attack doesn't hurt, but temporarily stuns target
- slap cancels stun
sprint?

remotetransform2d as the launch anchor could fix the tween problem and help tell who threw a projectile (set to parent's group on launch() and clear group at the end of thrown)
